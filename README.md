# cocos2d-x-js-rpg-test
In this tiny project I am trying out cocos features so I can determine if I can develop an isometric rpg later.

How to run the game
-----------------------
1. Delete `index.html`
2. Rename `stanalone.html` to `index.html`

How to run the game in developer mode
-----------------------
1. Download the code from [cocos2d download site][4]
2. Run `setup.py`
3. Make a new boilerplate Javascript project with the following command

`cocos new GameName -l js`

4. Copy the "frameworks" folder from your new JS project to the root directory of this project
